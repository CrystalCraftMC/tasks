How to request support
======================

The following guidelines help ensure the quickest response to your ticket.
Please adhere to these guidelines for the quickest resolution of a problem.


## Use issue template

When you file a new ticket / issue, a template will appear.
The template helps me better understand the problem or issue.
Please make sure to use this template.
This will hopefully mean I ask less questions and I can resolve the issue faster.


## Use labels

There is a [set of labels](https://github.com/jwflory/ccmc-infrastructure/labels "Labels to use for issues / tickets") you can use on a ticket.
Most of the labels are for my use.
However, **all new tickets need two labels** at minimum.

* **Service type**: `database`, `multicraft`, `website`
* **Priority**: `priority:low`, `priority:med`, `priority:high`, `priority:crit`

Specifying the service type helps me understand the type of problem you are experiencing.
Specifying the priority helps me understand how urgent the problem is.
Please use your best judgment for setting the priority label.


## Questions

This is not the best place to ask questions.
For questions and discussion, please use the `#sysadmin` channel on the Discord server.
Make sure to tag me, `@jwf`, to get my attention.

For urgent, critical issues, file a ticket and alert me by Telegram (`@jwflory`) or by SMS (`+1 (770) 527-8614`).
