To-do tracker for tasks, goals, and objectives for CrystalCraftMC


## About

This repo is a task tracker for CrystalCraftMC. No code lives in this
repository, but it keeps track of information and tasks to be done for CCMC. You
can find these tasks and tickets in the form of GitHub issues
[here](https://github.com/CrystalCraftMC/tasks/issues "See what CrystalCraftMC is up to").

**These are open for everyone!** The CCMC Staff primarily use this for planning
and tracking what needs to be done, but any community member is welcome to
participate and add their voice. You're also welcome to file your own issues
too.
